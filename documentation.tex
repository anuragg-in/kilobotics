\chapter{Efficient star-planet orbiting using a finite state machine}
\section{Finite state machine (FSM)}
Before discussing FSM, let us discuss the three individual terms comprising this concept viz. finite, state and machine. Finite refers to a fixed number, whereas state means the mode or position. For example, in case of a traffic light signal, we have three different states: red, yellow and green. Thus, FSM denotes a machine with fixed number of states. \cite{LL-GM-BS-rderts} views a finite state machine as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A set of input events
	\item A set of output events
	\item A set of states
	\item A function that maps states and input to output
	\item A function that maps states and inputs to states
	\item A description of the initial state
\end{itemize}
\noindent In our case of star-planet orbiting, we model the problem as a FSM, given its suitability to modularizing different components of algorithm. Our mechanism for orbiting is very similar to those provided at Kilobotics website, and elaborately covered in details in last lecture, although implementation using a FSM dramatically simplifies integrating macros of large size. Our main contribution in this chapter comprises of a novel and robust obstacle avoidance algorithm to prevent planet from hitting the star if it starts too close to it and also, a simple extension of existing orbiting algorithm for multiple stars setting. Both of these contributions will be dealt with extensively in coming sections. 

%\section{Discussion}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Motor was turned on for 40ms.
%\item Spinup motor was not used as it creates chaos.
%\item Revolution time around 6 minutes.
%\item Only left, right motion was used for orbiting.
%\item Algorithm can be improved using soft delay instead of hard delay.
%\item Algorithm for escaping $too\_close$ distance worked and then stopped working suddenly.
%\item Use $max\_distance-min\_distance>some\_threshold$ to obtain orientation away from obstacle. This is more robust than checking for transition from increasing to decreasing distance.
%\item Draw flowchart for the algorithm.
%\item Motor spinup is to be used.
%\item Too close escape worked. Oscillations due to threshold on difference to check from minimum distance ($threshold\_rotate = $). New robust algorithm was used. In worst case, it will require one complete rotation.
%\item When only one distance was used, it created instability in tracking the desired orbit because planet makes only one reception and makes it decision entirely on that estimated distance.
%\item Minimum of four communication distance was used. When planet is in communication range of both the robots, it makes decision quickly but when it is in communication range of only one robot, it takes longer as it takes more time to receive 4 communication from a single star than 4 communication from two star. (Motor delay = 200, No. of communications = 4, Time = 23 minutes, 9:30 p.m.).
%\item (Motor delay = 500, No. of communications = 2, Time = 5 minutes, 9:30 p.m.). This time there is possibility of receiving communication from same star twice but that is small over successive trials.
%\item Too close escape. (Motor delay = 500, threshold = 14, radius = 65, Time = 2 minutes, 10:23 p.m.)
%\item Orbiting three stars (Time = 6 minutes, Communication = 4, Motor delay = 500).
%\item Assign different data to stars.
%\item Use float to store distance.
%\end{itemize}
\section{Flowchart}
Flowchart for orbit after escape algorithm has been divided into two parts comprising of Figure \ref{fig:orbit_after_escape1} and \ref{fig:orbit_after_escape2}. First part discusses extension of orbit algorithm for multiple star setting whereas the latter illustrates the algorithm for escaping obstacle.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{star_planet_escape1}
	\caption{Flowchart for orbiting after escape algorithm (Part I)}
	\label{fig:orbit_after_escape1}
\end{figure}

In star planet orbiting algorithm, while measuring distance between stars and planet, the parameter \texttt{NUMBER\_COMMUNICATION} defines how many messages should a planet aggregate before making a decision. Accordingly, planet identifies the nearest star based on the strength of signal received in previous step. Considering the nearest star, the planet either moves left or right to maintain \texttt{DESIRED\_DISTANCE}. The parameter \texttt{message\_rx\_status} is used to keep count of successful communications.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.55]{star_planet_escape2}
	\caption{Flowchart for orbiting after escape algorithm (Part II)}
	\label{fig:orbit_after_escape2}
\end{figure}

The parameter \texttt{NUMBER\_COMMUNICATION} affects speed of the planet. For instance, if the number of stars in communication range is more, the planet moves faster than having only one star in communication range. This is due to the fact that it needs to receive \texttt{NUMBER\_COMMUNICATION} times of measurements  from only one star and then, decides the motion. Here are two observations, which show how the revolution time is getting varied with the number of  communications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Motor delay = 200, Number of communications = 4, Revolution time
	      = 23 minutes
	\item Motor delay = 500, Number of communications = 2, Revolution time = 5 minutes
\end{itemize}

While escaping from \texttt{TOO\_CLOSE} region, we compare the successive distance measurements to check for the orientation of planet from star. In our early version of algorithm, we tried to detect transition of \texttt{distance} from increasing to decreasing state as the instant when planet is oriented away from star but becase of uncertainity in measurements, this led to unwanted behaviour. Hence, we decided to keep track of \texttt{minimum\_distance} from star and check for the condition \texttt{distance - min\_distance > THRESHOLD\_ROTATE} to hold. By appropriately choosing the parameter \texttt{THRESHOLD\_ROTATE}, we managed to get the final orientation of planet away from direction of star. Moreover, the modified algorithm sans over-dependence on accuracy of a single measurement, leading to filter like behaviour and an eventual robustness of solution.\\
It is worth mentioning that the robustness comes at an additional cost, which is, in worst case scenario, planet would require one complete revolution before being able to escape from \texttt{TOO\_CLOSE} region of star. For more detailed understanding of algorithm, readers are referred to code in Appendix \ref{c_orbit}.


\section{Demonstration}
Figure \ref{fig:efficient_star_planet_orbiting} provides link to the demo for orbiting of planet around the star given star starts near the desired distance.

	\caption{\href{https://youtu.be/LRgOzhAJI1k}{Efficient star-planet orbiting}}
	\label{fig:efficient_star_planet_orbiting}
\end{figure}
We have hard delays in our current implementation which increases the revolution time. In future, one can replace them with soft delays to alleviate the time of revolution.

Figure \ref{fig:orbit_after_escape} provides link to the demo of algorithm for planet to go away from too close region using a robust algorithm followed by orbiting.

	\label{fig:orbit_after_escape}
\end{figure}
It is evident from demo that there is a damped oscillation before planet starts orbiting. This can be attributed to difference in centre of rotation of kilobots for clockwise and anti-clockwise turn. If it were to rotate about its centre, the oscillations would not have been as heightened as in current scenario.

Figure \ref{fig:orbit_two_star_comm1} provides link to the demo of algorithm for planet to orbit around two stars. Only single communication was used to identify minimum distance, leading to instability which can be attributed to CSMA/CD \cite{WEBOPEDIA-csma-cd} communication protocol followed by Kilobots.

\chapter{Shape formation using Kilobots}
In this chapter, we will discuss an algorithm motivated by the work \cite{MR-AC-RN:2014} of SSL lab, Harvard University, for shape formation. Rather than implementing the entire algorithm, we will only consider a portion of it, assuming that the next robot to be placed is available near origin.
\section{Framework}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Three robots (guides) are used as reference for axis orientation.
	\item A robot (builder) participating in shape formation starts near the left of origin.
	\item In its effort to reach the desired location, builder orbits around the partial shape using the algorithm presented in last chapter.
	\item The builder stops orbiting when it reaches the desired location.
	\item Builder becomes a guide, thereby, helping the next builder.
\end{itemize}
To participate in shape formation, builders need to decide upon what global shape to form. This is achieved by sharing a shape matrix encapsulating the desired shape as an array of 5-tuple. The 5-tuple contains the following information necessary for establishing builders at desired location:
\begin{align}
	\left(
	\begin{matrix}
	Index & Neighbour_1 & Desired\ distance_1 & Neighbour_2 & Desired\ distance_2 
	\end{matrix}
	\right)
\end{align}
For forming a linear shape of width 2, the shape matrix would look like
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:shape_matrix_linear}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	3      & 1      & 1      & 2      & 1        \\
	4      & 2      & 1      & 3      & \sqrt{2} \\
	5      & 3      & 1      & 4      & 1        \\
	\cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots   
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
It is important to note that we require the shape to ensure two guides for each builder node or else builder would fail to localize correctly.
\section{Flowchart}
Figure \ref{fig:fc_shape_form} explains the algorithm for shape formation. Our algorithm differs from \cite{MR-AC-RN:2014} in its implementation of shape matrix, and localization to be discussed later in next section.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{images/shape_formation}
	\caption{Flowchart for shape formation algorithm}
	\label{fig:fc_shape_form}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}
Figure \ref{fig:shape_formation_process_1} and \ref{fig:shape_formation_process_2} helps in visualizing the shape formation process for shape matrix \eqref{eq:shape_matrix_linear}, which corresponds to a line of width 2. Black circles indicate guide robots which continuously transmit their \texttt{Index}, whereas grey circles indicate the oncoming builder robot. Shaded circle corresponds to a builder transforming into a guide. A builder is always in listener mode, whereas a guide is always in speaker mode of communication. Dotted lines trace the path of builder.

When first builder initialized with \texttt{Index=3} starts its journey, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:shape_formation_process_1}, it never faces a situation which requires \texttt{Index} update and hence, it ultimately reaches the desired location corresponding to \texttt{Index=3} and transforms into a guide robot. 
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{"images/shape_formation_process_1"}
	\caption{First builder taking its position}
	\label{fig:shape_formation_process_1}
\end{figure}
When second builder arrives with \texttt{Index=3}, as n in Figure \ref{fig:shape_formation_process_2}, it continues on its journey to occupy the desired location coresponding to \texttt{Index=3}, but when it comes in the communication range of new guide with \texttt{Index=3}, it realizes that it needs to update its \texttt{Index} to \texttt{4}. Following which, it travels to the desired location corresponding to \texttt{Index=4} and transforms into a guide.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{"images/shape_formation_process_2"}
	\caption{Second builder taking its position}
	\label{fig:shape_formation_process_2}
\end{figure}

\section{Demonstration}
\texttt{EPSILON\_MARGIN} and \texttt{MOTOR\_ON\_DURATION} plays an essential role in determining the stability and accuracy of shape formation. For large \texttt{MOTOR\_ON\_DURATION}, it is likely for builder to go beyond its desired location and continue orbiting whereas for larger \texttt{EPSILON\_MARGIN}, we get distortion in shape. Moreover, we can not choose very small \texttt{EPSILON\_MARGIN} due to error in measurements. One way to improve accuracy of shape is by adaptively decreasing the \texttt{MOTOR\_ON\_DURATION} of builder when it comes in the comunication range of desired neighbours. The two parameters discussed are borrowed from previous chapter. For detailed understanding of these parameters, readers are motivated to go through code in Appendix \ref{c_shape_form}\\
Figure \ref{fig:shape_formation_demo} provides the link to video of shape formation in action. Shape matrix \eqref{eq:shape_matrix_linear} was fed to each builder robots to form a rectangle  breadth=2 and length=3. Values for \texttt{EPSILON\_MARGIN} and \texttt{MOTOR\_ON\_DURATION} were assigned to 5 and 500 respectively. For abovementioned values of parameters, the desired shape formation took place in roughly 10 minutes with observable distortions in shape. As the shape becomes larger and larger, accumulations of these errors could prevent a builder from localization, given our naive implementation of the algorithm. We also experimented with smaller values of \texttt{EPSILON\_MARGIN}, namely 2, but because of measurement noise, builders failed to establish themselves at desired location with large probability and continued orbiting around guides. Same observations were made for large values of \texttt{MOTOR\_ON\_DURATION}, namely 1000, as we had implemented hard delays. Although, larger values decreased the time to reach near the desired region, builders failed to localize within desired error margin. This could be attributed to large displacement being made before every localization step.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\fbox{\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{images/shape_formation_demo}}
	\caption{\href{https://youtu.be/SoDq9GQvNAE}{Shape formation by kilobots (Shape: Rectangle of breadth=2 and length=3)}}
	\label{fig:shape_formation_demo}
\end{figure}
Based on our discussion, inclusion of following measures would boost the performance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Adaptively decreasing the \texttt{MOTOR\_ON\_DURATION} as the builder reaches closer to its target location. Doing this would significantly improve the runtime of shape formation and accuracy of localization if calibrated with proper choice of \texttt{EPSILON\_MARGIN}.
    \item Conversion of hard delays to soft delays, thereby, decreasing the overall run time.
    \item Use of optimization based approach for localization to incorporate uncertainity in measurements.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusion}
During our lab work on Kilobotics, we developed essential building blocks for implementation of shape formation algorithm. In the process, we tested algorithms for efficient orbiting, algorithm for escaping an obstacle, algorithm for orbiting multiple stars, and lastly, we also implemented a rudimentary shape formation algorithm for Kilobots. There's a lot which needs to be achieved in terms of robustness in performance and integration of individual building blocks. Further, one may also pursue development of macros to generate shape matrix from a bitmap image.
