\chapter{Efficient star-planet orbiting using a finite state machine}
\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Motor was turned on for 40ms.
    \item Spinup motor was not used as it creates chaos.
    \item Revolution time around 6 minutes.
    \item Only left, right motion was used for orbiting.
    \item Algorithm can be improved using soft delay instead of hard delay.
    \item Algorithm for escaping $too\_close$ distance worked and then stopped working suddenly.
    \item Use $max\_distance-min\_distance>some\_threshold$ to obtain orientation away from obstacle. This is more robust than checking for transition from increasing to decreasing distance.
    \item Draw flowchart for the algorithm.
    \item Motor spinup is to be used.
    \item Too close escape worked. Oscillations due to threshold on difference to check from minimum distance ($threshold\_rotate = $). New robust algorithm was used. In worst case, it will require one complete rotation.
    \item When only one distance was used, it created instability in tracking the desired orbit because planet makes only one reception and makes it decision entirely on that estimated distance.
    \item Minimum of four communication distance was used. When planet is in communication range of both the robots, it makes decision quickly but when it is in communication range of only one robot, it takes longer as it takes more time to receive 4 communication from a single star than 4 communication from two star. (Motor delay = 200, No. of communications = 4, Time = 23 minutes, 9:30 p.m.).
    \item (Motor delay = 500, No. of communications = 2, Time = 5 minutes, 9:30 p.m.). This time there is possibility of receiving communication from same star twice but that is small over successive trials.
    \item Too close escape. (Motor delay = 500, threshold = 14, radius = 65, Time = 2 minutes, 10:23 p.m.)
    \item Orbiting three stars (Time = 6 minutes, Communication = 4, Motor delay = 500).
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Future works}
In this chapter, we will discuss an algorithm motivated by the work \cite{MR-AC-RN:2014} of SSL lab, Harvard University, for shape formation. Rather than implementing the entire algorithm, we will only consider a portion of it assuming that the next robot to be placed is available near origin.
\section{Shape formation}
\begin{itemize}
        \item Three robots (guides) are to be used as reference for axis orientation.
        \item A robot (builder) to participate in shape formation starts near the left of origin.
        \item The robot continues to orbit using the orbiting algorithm of previous chapter.
        \item The builder stops orbiting and establishes itself at desired location when it finds itself meeting the required location condition shared amongst builders.
\end{itemize}
To participate in shape formation, builders need to decide upon what global shape to form. This is achieved by sharing a shape matrix encapsulating the desired shape as an array of 5 touple.
\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}
    INDEX & NEIGHBOUR\_1 & DESIRED\_DISTANCE\_1 & NEIGHBOUR\_2 & DESIRED\_DISTANCE\_2\\
    \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots\\
    \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
For forming a linear shape of width 2, the shape matrix would look like
\begin{align}
\label{eq:shape_matrix_linear}
\begin{bmatrix}
    3 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1\\
    4 & 2 & 1 & 3 & \sqrt{2}\\
    5 & 3 & 1 & 4 & 1\\
    \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots & \cdots
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
\subsection{Flowchart}
Figure \ref{fig:fc_shape_form} explains the algorithm for shape formation.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion}
Figure \ref{fig:shape_formation_process_1} and \ref{fig:shape_formation_process_2} helps in visualizing the shape formation process for shape matrix of \eqref{eq:shape_matrix_linear}, which corresponds to a line of width 2.

\chapter{Conclusion}
In the second part of lab work, we aimed to develop building blocks for shape formation. In the process, we tested algorithms for an efficient orbiting, algorithm for escaping an obstacle, and lastly, an algorithm for orbiting multiple stars. We ended with a discussion on data structure and algorithm design for shape formation by utilizing the orbiting algorithm.
